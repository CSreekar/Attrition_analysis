Hello I made this project during my first internship at Steel Authority of India. Used a publicly available dummy dataset to perform Exploratory data analysis techniques.

# Attrition_analysis
Attrition is a process in which the workforce dwindles at a company, following a period in which a number of people retire or resign, and are not replaced. - A reduction
in staff due to attrition is often called a hiring freeze and is seen as a less disruptive way to trim the workforce and reduce payroll than layoffs - In this NoteBook our Aim will be to analyze the datasets completely wrt each and feature and find the reason behind Attrition of Employees.

# Findings
The Data Analysis yielded several noteworthy findings:

a) Top Factors Influencing Attrition: The key drivers of employee attrition were
identified as job satisfaction, work-life balance, career growth opportunities,
compensation and benefits.

b) At-Risk Employee Segments: Identified specific employee segments, such as
those in certain job roles, at particular experience levels, or within specific age
ranges, that exhibited higher attrition rates.

c) Early Warning Indicators: By analyzing historical data, we developed a system
to identify early warning signs of potential attrition, allowing proactive
intervention and retention strategies.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the Employee Attrition Analysis Project has provided valuable
insights into the factors influencing attrition within our organization. By
implementing the recommendations based on our findings, we can effectively
address attrition rates and improve employee retention.
One key aspect to enhance the accuracy of the logistic regression model is to
further refine the feature selection process. By identifying additional relevant
variables and fine-tuning their impact on attrition prediction, we can increase the
model's accuracy score and make more precise predictions.
Looking ahead, the applications of this project extend beyond attrition analysis.
The insights gained can inform talent acquisition and recruitment strategies,
allowing us to attract candidates who align with our organization's culture and
values. Additionally, the predictive model can be integrated into our performance
management system, identifying employees who may require additional support
or recognition.
Lastly, working on this project has been a wonderful learning experience. The
combination of engineering and data analysis skills, coupled with the challenges
of dealing with real-world organizational data, has broadened my understanding
of employee dynamics and the importance of data-driven decision-making. I am
grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the organization's success through
this project and look forward to leveraging these insights for future projects and
initiatives.
